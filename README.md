# Scheme_interpreter
Java based Interpreter for Scheme


# Description
This is a comprehensive interpreter for the Scheme programming language using Java, implementing essential features such as lambda expressions, conditionals, list manipulation, and logic and arithmetic operations.

It utilizes object-oriented principles to ensure modularity and maintainability of the codebase and was developed in a test-driven development process, with rigorous unit and integration testing to guarantee high-quality and reliable functionality. It includes a custom parser, tokenizer, and evaluator to process and evaluate complex, nested Scheme expressions, recursive calls and lists, providing a robust solution for handling Scheme language operations.
